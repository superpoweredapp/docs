title: "Authentication"
---

Vapi relies on API keys for secure authentication.

**Keep your API key a secret.** Never share it with others or reveal it in client-side code such as browsers or apps. Route all production requests through your own backend server, where you can safely load your API key from an environment variable or a key management service.

To authenticate, include your API key in the Authorization HTTP header for all API requests, using the following format:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer VAPI_API_KEY'
```
