# Introduction

The [API](/api-reference) is the main way to interact with the platform. It allows you to create and manage agents, place outbound calls, and receive inbound calls.

## [Agents](/api-reference/agent)

`Agent` is a fancy word for an AI configuration that can be used in both inbound and outbound phone calls. (Coming soon, you'll also be able to use your agents on web with a snippet!)

You can specify the agent's voice, context, and other properties. You can use an agent's `id` when placing an outbound call or create an `InboundPhone` number that will use the agent when receiving inbound calls.

### Callback URL

As part of the `Agent`, you can specify a `callbackUrl`. This is your server's URL that the agent will use when retreiving context, performing function calls, and sending call summaries / recordings.

#### Retreiving Context

If you need to customize the agent's context based on who the user is, or to retrieve context from your database, you can enable `getContextFromCallback` when creating an agent.

If `getContextFromCallback` is enabled and a call begins, the agent will make a `GET` request to the `callbackUrl` with the `userPhoneNumber` and `agentId` as query parameters. Your server should respond with a JSON object containing the context, like so:

```json
{
  "context": "You are an assistant at a law firm. You are calling to confirm an appointment with a client."
}
```

#### Function Calling

Vapi fully supports OpenAI's function calling API, so you can have agents ping your server to perform actions like sending emails, retrieve information, and more. GPT4 will automatically determine what functions to call based on the context and the user's input.

If `functions` are defined on the agent, it will use the `callbackUrl` to make a `POST` request with the following body:

<Snippet file="function.body.mdx" />

Your server should respond with a JSON object containing the function's response, like so:

```json
{
  "result": "Your email has been sent."
}
```

#### End of Call Report

When a call ends, the agent will make a `POST` request to the `callbackUrl` with the following body:

<Snippet file="end.body.mdx" />

#### [`Agent`](/api-reference/agent)

An agent is an AI that can talk. You can specify its context, voice, and other properties. You can use an agent when placing an outbound call. You can also assign an agent a phoneNumber for inbound calls.

#### [`Call`](/api-reference/call)

A call does exactly what it says on the tin. It will initiate an outbound call to the phone number you specify. While starting a call, you can create an agent [on the fly](/api-reference/call/create.transient), or use [an existing one](/api-reference/call/create).
